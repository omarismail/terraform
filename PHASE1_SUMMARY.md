# Phase 1 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Phase 1 implements a minimal viable integration system for Terraform that allows external processes to receive notifications about resource changes during the plan phase. This MVP demonstrates the core concepts while keeping the implementation simple and focused.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Configuration Support (`internal/configs/integration.go`)
- Created `Integration` type to represent integration blocks
- Added parsing support for integration blocks in terraform {} blocks only
- Basic validation of required fields (name and source)

### 2. Parser Modifications
- **`internal/configs/parser_config.go`**: Added integration block to terraformBlockSchema
- **`internal/configs/module.go`**: 
  - Added Integrations field to File and Module structs
  - Added integration processing in appendFile method
  - Initialized Integrations map in NewModule

### 3. Integration Manager (`internal/terraform/integration_manager.go`)
- Process lifecycle management (start/stop)
- JSON-RPC communication over stdio
- Sequential hook execution (parallel execution for Phase 2)
- Basic error handling and logging

### 4. Integration Hook (`internal/terraform/hook_integration.go`)
- Implements Terraform's Hook interface
- Only PostDiff (post-plan) hook implemented
- Converts Terraform's internal data to JSON-compatible format
- Logs integration responses but doesn't fail operations (Phase 1)

### 5. Context Integration (`internal/backend/local/backend_local.go`)
- Modified localRunDirect to start integrations if configured
- Creates IntegrationManager and IntegrationHook
- Adds hook to the context's hook chain

### 6. Sample Integrations
- **Logger**: Simple integration that logs all resource changes
- **Cost Estimator**: Existing integration adapted for Phase 1 protocol

## How It Works

1. User defines integrations in terraform configuration:
   ```hcl
   terraform {
     integration "logger" {
       source = "./path/to/integration"
     }
   }
   ```

2. When `terraform plan` runs:
   - Parser loads integration configuration
   - Backend creates IntegrationManager
   - IntegrationManager starts integration processes
   - Each integration receives "initialize" request
   - IntegrationHook is added to context hooks

3. For each resource change:
   - PostDiff hook is called
   - IntegrationHook converts resource data to JSON
   - Sends "post-plan" request to each integration
   - Logs responses but doesn't affect operation

4. On completion:
   - Integrations receive shutdown notification
   - Processes are terminated

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Stdio-based JSON-RPC**: Simple, language-agnostic protocol
2. **Hook-based Integration**: Leverages existing Terraform extension points
3. **Sequential Execution**: Simpler for Phase 1, parallel in Phase 2
4. **No Operation Control**: Integrations can't fail plans in Phase 1
5. **Local Files Only**: No registry support in Phase 1

## Testing

Run the test configuration in `test-phase1/`:
```bash
cd test-phase1
terraform init
terraform plan
```

Expected behavior:
- Integration processes start successfully
- Logger shows resource changes in output
- Cost estimator shows estimates (if using that integration)
- Log file created with detailed information
- Terraform plan completes normally

## Known Limitations

1. **No cleanup on error**: Integration processes may be orphaned
2. **No timeout handling**: Slow integrations can hang Terraform
3. **Basic error handling**: Errors are logged but not always graceful
4. **Limited hook coverage**: Only post-plan, no apply/refresh hooks
5. **No provider scoping**: All integrations see all resources
6. **No state metadata**: Integration results aren't persisted

## Code Changes Summary

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `internal/configs/integration.go` | New file - Integration types |
| `internal/configs/parser_config.go` | Added integration to terraform block schema |
| `internal/configs/module.go` | Added Integrations field and processing |
| `internal/terraform/integration_manager.go` | New file - Process management |
| `internal/terraform/hook_integration.go` | New file - Hook implementation |
| `internal/backend/local/backend_local.go` | Start integrations in localRunDirect |

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. Add all resource-level hooks (pre/post plan, apply, refresh)
2. Allow integrations to fail operations
3. Add provider-level integration support
4. Implement parallel hook execution
5. Add proper cleanup and timeout handling
6. Support operation-level hooks

This Phase 1 implementation provides a solid foundation for the Integration SDK while keeping the scope manageable and testable.
