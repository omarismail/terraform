# Phase 1 Integration SDK - Test Results

## Test Environment

- **Terraform Version**: Custom build with Phase 1 integration support
- **Test Configuration**: `test-phase1/main.tf`
- **Integrations Tested**:
  - Logger Integration (`sample-integrations/logger/index.js`)
  - Cost Estimator Integration (`sample-integrations/cost-estimator/index.js`)

## Test Results: ✅ SUCCESS

### 1. Configuration Parsing
✅ Integration blocks are correctly parsed from terraform {} blocks
✅ Multiple integrations can be configured
✅ Integration source paths are resolved correctly

### 2. Integration Process Management
✅ Integration processes start successfully
✅ Node.js integrations work via shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env node`)
✅ Processes receive initialization requests
✅ JSON-RPC communication over stdio works correctly

### 3. Hook Execution
✅ PostDiff (post-plan) hook is called for each resource
✅ Resource data is correctly converted from cty to JSON
✅ All 7 test resources triggered the hook:
   - terraform_data.provisioner_test
   - random_integer.port
   - random_string.example
   - random_password.database
   - terraform_data.config
   - terraform_data.example
   - time_sleep.wait_30_seconds

### 4. Integration Responses
✅ Logger integration successfully logged all resources
✅ Cost estimator correctly identified it couldn't estimate non-AWS resources
✅ Integration messages appear in Terraform output (with TF_LOG=INFO)
✅ Log file created with detailed resource information

### 5. Error Handling
✅ Integration errors don't crash Terraform (Phase 1 design)
✅ Integration stderr is captured and logged
✅ Multiple integrations run without conflicts

## Log Output Evidence

The `terraform-integration.log` file shows:
- Integration started successfully
- Received initialization with Terraform version 1.9.0
- Logged all 7 resources with correct types and actions
- All resources showed "Create" action as expected for new resources

## Console Output (with TF_LOG=INFO)

```

## Known Limitations (As Designed for Phase 1)

1. ❌ Integrations cannot fail operations (only log)
2. ❌ Only post-plan hook is implemented
3. ❌ No provider-level integration support
4. ❌ No cleanup on error (processes may be orphaned)
5. ❌ No state metadata storage
6. ❌ Integration output only visible with TF_LOG enabled

## Conclusion

Phase 1 implementation is working as designed. The basic integration infrastructure is functional and provides a solid foundation for Phase 2 enhancements. The system successfully:

1. Parses integration configuration
2. Starts and manages integration processes
3. Communicates via JSON-RPC
4. Calls hooks during plan operations
5. Handles multiple integrations simultaneously

## Next Steps for Phase 2

1. Implement all resource-level hooks (pre/post plan, apply, refresh)
2. Allow integrations to fail operations
3. Add proper process cleanup
4. Implement provider-level integrations
5. Add timeout handling
6. Make integration output visible without debug logging
