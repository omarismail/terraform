# Terraform Integration SDK - Implementation Phases

This document outlines a phased approach to implementing the Integration SDK, where each phase delivers a working prototype that can be tested and validated before proceeding to the next phase.

## Phase 1: Basic Local Integration Support (MVP)

**Goal**: Create a minimal working integration system that can run local executables and communicate via JSON-RPC.

### Deliverables
- Basic configuration parsing for integration blocks in terraform blocks only
- Simple integration manager that can start/stop local processes
- JSON-RPC transport for stdio communication
- Hook integration for `post-plan-resource` only
- Basic example integration that logs resource changes

### What Works
- Users can define integrations in `terraform {}` blocks
- Integrations can receive post-plan-resource events
- Integrations can log messages but cannot fail operations
- Local executable integrations only

### Testing
```hcl
terraform {
  integration "logger" {
    source = "./integrations/logger"
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

### Success Criteria
- Integration process starts when running `terraform plan`
- Integration receives resource data and can log it
- Integration process cleanly shuts down

## Phase 2: Full Hook Support & Operation Control

**Goal**: Expand hook coverage and allow integrations to control Terraform operations.

### Deliverables
- Support for all resource-level hooks (pre/post plan-resource, apply-resource, refresh-resource)
- Integration responses can halt Terraform operations
- Add operation-level hooks (plan-stage-complete, apply-stage-complete)
- Provider-level integration configuration
- Error handling and timeout support

### What Works
- Integrations can fail a plan or apply operation
- Provider-scoped integrations only see their resources
- Integrations can provide warnings without failing operations
- Better error messages and logging

### Testing
```hcl
terraform {
  integration "budget_checker" {
    source = "./integrations/budget-checker"
    config = {
      max_cost = 1000
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  integration "aws_tagger" {
    source = "./integrations/aws-tagger"
    config = {
      required_tags = ["Environment", "Owner"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Success Criteria
- Integrations can prevent resources from being created
- Provider-scoped integrations work correctly
- Timeouts prevent hanging integrations
- Clear error messages when integrations fail

## Phase 3: State Metadata Support

**Goal**: Allow integrations to store persistent metadata in the state file.

### Deliverables
- Extend state format to support integration metadata
- Hook for state updates
- Metadata namespacing per integration
- State file migration support

### What Works
- Integrations can store metadata that persists between runs
- Metadata is properly namespaced to prevent conflicts
- State files remain backward compatible
- Metadata visible in `terraform show`

### Testing
```hcl
# Cost estimator stores cost data in state
terraform {
  integration "cost_tracker" {
    source = "./integrations/cost-tracker"
  }
}

# After apply, state contains:
# {
#   "integration_metadata": {
#     "cost_tracker": {
#       "monthly_cost": 150.00,
#       "last_updated": "2024-01-15"
#     }
#   }
# }
```

### Success Criteria
- Metadata persists across terraform runs
- State remains valid for older Terraform versions
- Metadata can be queried and reported on

## Phase 4: Advanced Integration Features

**Goal**: Add sophisticated integration capabilities for production use.

### Deliverables
- Integration binary discovery (PATH, relative paths)
- Integration configuration validation
- Parallel hook execution with proper ordering
- Integration health checks and recovery
- Performance metrics and monitoring

### What Works
- Integrations are discovered automatically
- Failed integrations can be restarted
- Performance overhead is minimal
- Detailed metrics available for debugging

### Testing
- Large-scale configurations with multiple integrations
- Integration crash recovery
- Performance benchmarks

### Success Criteria
- Less than 10% performance overhead
- Graceful handling of integration failures
- Clear debugging information available

## Phase 5: Remote Integration Support

**Goal**: Support remote integrations and integration registry.

### Deliverables
- Integration registry protocol
- Version constraints for integrations
- Automatic integration downloading
- Integration caching
- Digital signatures for integrations

### What Works
- Integrations can be referenced by registry URLs
- Version constraints ensure compatibility
- Integrations are cached locally
- Security through code signing

### Testing
```hcl
terraform {
  integration "cost_estimator" {
    source  = "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/cost-estimator"
    version = "~> 1.0"
  }
}
```

### Success Criteria
- Registry protocol is well-defined
- Integration updates are handled gracefully
- Security model prevents malicious integrations

## Phase 6: Enterprise Features

**Goal**: Add features needed for enterprise adoption.

### Deliverables
- Integration allowlists/denylists
- Audit logging for integration actions
- Resource filtering for integrations
- Integration composition and chaining
- Administrative controls

### What Works
- Organizations can control which integrations are allowed
- Full audit trail of integration decisions
- Fine-grained control over integration scope
- Multiple integrations can be composed

### Testing
- Enterprise policy scenarios
- Compliance and audit requirements
- Multi-team environments

### Success Criteria
- Meets enterprise security requirements
- Scalable to thousands of resources
- Clear audit trail for compliance

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Dependencies | Risk Level |
|-------|----------|--------------|------------|
| Phase 1 | 2-3 weeks | None | Low |
| Phase 2 | 3-4 weeks | Phase 1 | Medium |
| Phase 3 | 2-3 weeks | Phase 2 | Medium |
| Phase 4 | 3-4 weeks | Phase 3 | Low |
| Phase 5 | 4-6 weeks | Phase 4 | High |
| Phase 6 | 4-6 weeks | Phase 5 | Medium |

## Rollout Strategy

1. **Alpha Release (Phase 1-2)**: Internal testing with select partners
2. **Beta Release (Phase 3-4)**: Public beta with experimental flag
3. **GA Release (Phase 5)**: General availability with stability guarantees
4. **Enterprise Release (Phase 6)**: Additional features for enterprise customers

## Backward Compatibility

Each phase maintains backward compatibility:
- Configuration files without integrations work unchanged
- State files remain readable by older Terraform versions
- Integration features are opt-in via configuration
- No changes to existing provider protocols

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: Number of integrations published and used
- **Performance**: Less than 10% overhead for typical operations  
- **Reliability**: 99.9% success rate for integration operations
- **Developer Experience**: Time to create first integration < 1 hour
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback from beta users

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Performance Risk**: Implement aggressive timeouts and parallel execution
2. **Security Risk**: Sandbox integrations and implement signing
3. **Compatibility Risk**: Extensive testing with existing configurations
4. **Adoption Risk**: Work closely with popular tool maintainers (OPA, Sentinel, etc.)

This phased approach ensures each milestone delivers value while building toward the complete Integration SDK vision.
